Two Sources, One Destination

Mesh topology can be represented as a 2D matrix, where each element is a node/router \n
P1 = S1-->D and P2 = S2-->D should have equal number of hops \n
S1 and S2 should at least be one hop apart \n
* Find all the possible pairs (P1, P2) \n
* Sort these pairs according to the number of hops
