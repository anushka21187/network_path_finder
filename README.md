Two Sources, One Destination

Mesh topology can be represented as a 2D matrix, where each element is a node/router

P1 = S1-->D and P2 = S2-->D should have equal number of hops 

S1 and S2 should at least be one hop apart 

1. Find all the possible pairs (P1, P2) 
2. Sort these pairs according to the number of hops
